# vim-maildrop

Syntax highlighting for Courier Maildrop filter configuration files.

## Installation

The layout conforms to the standard vim plugin layout. Either copy the files
into appropriate folders in your `.vim` directory, or use a plugin management
tool like pathogen or vundle.

## Usage

By default, the plugin treats files named `.mailfiter`, `*.drop` and
`*.maildrop` as maildrop filter files, and syntax highlighting will be
activated automatically for them.

## TODO

 * Error detection such as parens matching is unimplemented.
 * There's no explicit support for conditional/loop statement blocks.
